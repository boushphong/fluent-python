If the argument is not iterable, the call will fail fast with a very clear `TypeError` exception, right when the object is initialized. If you want to be more explict, you can wrap the `list()` call with `try/except` to customize the error message.\n",

    "Of course, calling `list()` on the argument would be bad if the data shouldn’t be copied, either because it’s too large or because the function, by design, needs to change it in place for the benefit of the caller, like `random.shuffle` does. In that case, a runtime check like `isinstance(x, abc.MutableSequence)` would be the way to go.\n",

Calling `len()` is usually very cheap, and an invalid argument will raise an error immediately.\n",
